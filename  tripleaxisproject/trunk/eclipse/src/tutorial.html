        <h2>Software for visualizing crystal structures</h2>
        I like to use the following two programs to visualize crystal structures:
        <ol>
        <li>
        <a href=http://homepage.mac.com/fujioizumi/visualization/VENUS.html/>VENUS</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        <a href=http://www.softbug.com/toycrate/>Ball&Sticks</a>
        </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    
    <p>
        <h2>Rietveld Programs</h2>
        <h3>GSAS  </h3>
        <p>
        GSAS is an excellent program for solving crystal structures.  It also useful
        for solving simple magnetic structures.  There is an excellent set of
        instructional materials available at <a href=http://www.aps.anl.gov/Xray_Science_Division/Powder_Diffraction_Crystallography/GSASEXPGUI.html>APS</a> courtesy of
        Brian Toby.  You can download the program itself <a href=http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/xtal/software/expgui/expgui.html>here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Fullprof </h3>
        <p>
        <a href=http://www.ill.eu/sites/fullprof/>Fullprof</a> is another excellent program for refining crystal and magnetic structures.  While it has a
        steep learning curve, it offers the ability to refine incommensurate magnetic structures which is lacking in GSAS.
        </p>
        
        Generally if you are interested in solving magnetic structures, I recommend you look at some of the material found
        <a href=http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/staff/taner/racmagstr/scope.html>here</a>.  Besides GBASIREPS found within Fullprof, I also
        recommend:
        <ol>
            <li><a href=http://www.chem.ucl.ac.uk/people/wills/index.html>Sarah</a> </li>
            <li><a href=http://www.ftj.agh.edu.pl/~sikora/modyopis.htm> MODY</a> </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>For windows, I would start by downloading the <a href=http://www.pythonxy.com/foreword.php>Python(x,y)</a> distribution
        of python.  It is large, but includes packages that many of you will find useful
        for scientific computing.  I will assume that you download the whole distribution and install it as
        full. (For mac users, <a href=http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>EPD</a>) is another option.)
            
        </p>
        <h3><a href=http://code.google.com/p/tripleaxisproject/>Triple Axis Project  (T.A.P.)</a></h3>
        <p>After you've installed python, I have developed a suite of programs for reducing neutron scattering
        data.  However, in order to use the source code, you will need to have access to svn.  For windows users,
        I suggest using <a href=>Tortoise SVN</a>.  After installing it, you will need to reboot your machine.
        Next, create a c:\tripleaxisproject directory.  Right click on the directory.  You will see an option
        called <em>Checkout SVN</em>.  Select that and in the resulting dialogue change the URL of the repository
        to: <em>http:&#47&#47tripleaxisproject.googlecode.com&#47svn&#47trunk&#47</em>
        
        </p>
        
        <h3><a href=http://code.google.com/p/spinwaves/>Spin Wave Analyzer (SPINAL)</a></h3>
        <p>My students and I have also developed a set of libraries for analyzing spinwaves.  Please look at
        the wiki to get started--there are even links to youtube videos!.  You
        will want to checkout the source from this one in the same manner as above.  However, this
        time make a directory, c:\spinwaves to hold the project locally.  The URL of the repository is:
        http://spinwaves.googlecode.com/svn/trunk      
        </p>
        <h3>Updating your path</h3>
        <p>
        You now need to tell python where these new directories are.  If you've used the
        defaults, go to c:/python26/lib/site-packages/ and add the following files:       
        <ol>
            <li>spinwaves.pth</li>
            <li>tripleaxisproject.pth</li>
            <li>wspinwaves.pth</li>
        </ol>
        from c:\tripleaxisproject\trunk\eclipse\src    
        </p>
        
        <h3>Magnetic Structure refinement</h3>
        <p>
        During the tutorial, I showed you some simple code to solve a magnetic structure.
        To test that everything works, go to your start menu and select "run" and type "cmd.exe"
        which will open a command window.  From there:
        <ol>
            <li>cd c:\tripleaxisproject\trunk\eclipse\src\utilities</li>
            <li>python magstruct_tut.py</li>
            <li>Congrats!  You've successfuly installed everything!</li>
        </ol>
        Now, as an exercise, can you plot the results of the fit as compared to the data?
