"""Prototype plottable object support.

The main point of this prototype is to provide a clean separation between
the style (plotter details: color, grids, widgets, etc.) and substance
(application details: which information to plot).  Programmers should not be
dictating line colours and plotting symbols.

Unlike the problem of style in CSS or Word, where most paragraphs look
the same, each line on a graph has to be distinguishable from its neighbours.
Our solution is to provide parametric styles, in which a number of
different classes of object (e.g., reflectometry data, reflectometry
theory) representing multiple graph primitives cycle through a colour
palette provided by the underlying plotter.

A full treatment would provide perceptual dimensions of prominence and
distinctiveness rather than a simple colour number.
"""

# Design question: who owns the color?
# Is it a property of the plottable?
# Or of the plottable as it exists on the graph?
# Or if the graph?
# If a plottable can appear on multiple graphs, in some case the
# color should be the same on each graph in which it appears, and
# in other cases (where multiple plottables from different graphs
# coexist), the color should be assigned by the graph.  In any case
# once a plottable is placed on the graph its color should not
# depend on the other plottables on the graph.  Furthermore, if
# a plottable is added and removed from a graph and added again,
# it may be nice, but not necessary, to have the color persist.
#
# The safest approach seems to be to give ownership of color
# to the graph, which will allocate the colors along with the
# plottable.  The plottable will need to return the number of
# colors that are needed.
#
# The situation is less clear for symbols.  It is less clear
# how much the application requires that symbols be unique across
# all plots on the graph.

# Support for ancient python versions

# Graph structure for holding multiple plottables
class Graph:
    """
    Generic plottables graph structure.
    
    Plot styles are based on color/symbol lists.  The user gets to select
    the list of colors/symbols/sizes to choose from, not the application
    developer.  The programmer only gets to add/remove lines from the
    plot and move to the next symbol/color.

    Another dimension is prominence, which refers to line sizes/point sizes.

    Axis transformations allow the user to select the coordinate view
    which provides clarity to the data.  There is no way we can provide
    every possible transformation for every application generically, so
    the plottable objects themselves will need to provide the transformations.
    Here are some examples from reflectometry:
       independent: x -> f(x)
          monitor scaling: y -> M*y
          log:  y -> log(y if y > min else min)
          cos:  y -> cos(y*pi/180)
       dependent:   x -> f(x,y)
          Q4:      y -> y*x^4
          fresnel: y -> y*fresnel(x)
       coordinated: x,y = f(x,y)
          Q:    x -> 2*pi/L (cos(x*pi/180) - cos(y*pi/180))
                y -> 2*pi/L (sin(x*pi/180) + sin(y*pi/180))
       reducing: x,y = f(x1,x2,y1,y2)
          spin asymmetry: x -> x1, y -> (y1 - y2)/(y1 + y2)
          vector net: x -> x1, y -> y1*cos(y2*pi/180)
    Multiple transformations are possible, such as Q4 spin asymmetry

    Axes have further complications in that the units of what are being
    plotted should correspond to the units on the axes.  Plotting multiple
    types on the same graph should be handled gracefully, e.g., by creating
    a separate tab for each available axis type, breaking into subplots,
    showing multiple axes on the same plot, or generating inset plots.
    Ultimately the decision should be left to the user.

    Graph properties such as grids/crosshairs should be under user control,
    as should the sizes of items such as axis fonts, etc.  No direct
    access will be provided to the application.

    Axis limits are mostly under user control.  If the user has zoomed or
    panned then those limits are preserved even if new data is plotted.
    The exception is when, e.g., scanning through a set of related lines
    in which the user may want to fix the limits so that user can compare
    the values directly.  Another exception is when creating multiple
    graphs sharing the same limits, though this case may be important
    enough that it is handled by the graph widget itself.  Axis limits
    will of course have to understand the effects of axis transformations.

    High level plottable objects may be composed of low level primitives.
    Operations such as legend/hide/show copy/paste, etc. need to operate
    on these primitives as a group.  E.g., allowing the user to have a
    working canvas where they can drag lines they want to save and annotate
    them.

    Graphs need to be printable.  A page layout program for entire plots
    would be nice.
