On Addition
(We'll call this a "distinct" flag and use in the __cmp__ method)

Distinct data points:
Signal (for example, Detector vs PSD, etc.)
Reference:  Monitor/Time (we don't want to combine these)
FixedE  (example Ef)
Lattice (assume distinct for now)
Orient
Monospacing
AnaSpacing
MonoVertiFocus
MonoHorizFocus
AnalyzerDetectorMode
AnalyzerFocusMode
filtran (IN/OUT) should be distinct
rc radial collimator For horizontal focusing mode, rc=a6
sc cosoller collimator  this is on a track and the convention is that the 50minute collimator should have the same
angle as a6 and the others have a fixed offset within some window.
premonocoll on a track, should be "50 min", "OUT", "Open"


Ignore: (this means that these fields go to None if not identical on addition)

Fixed These are fixed devices, for now, let's ignore these....We can try to handle these with a flag?
Apertures:  aperthori, apertvert
filrot
filtilt
focuscu --radius of curvature for cu monochromator in focusing condition
focuspg-- radius of curvature for pg monochrmoator in focusing condition








Subtraction
Generally, when subtracting, keep the signal, kill the background






Interpolation
timestamp->interpolate
temperature-> uncertainty is it difference between adjacent points, or intrinsic?
filters->if not the same, don't interpolate
collimations, if not the same, don't interpolate


PSD

For the values not scanned, (for example if we were doing an angle scan and temperature was a "spectator"),
then we would simply treat temperature as a "detector" and rebin it as well.


Open Questions
1) What do A,B,C,D polarization states mean?
2) Does a1=dfm
3) Values for the offsets in SC, rc, are the values for sc, rc "slowly varying" parameters?
4) For focuscu, focus pg, what are the numbers
5) Eventually get rid of h,k,l, hkl, qx, qy,qz dichotomy
